        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Luis Lionel Andres “Leo” Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario,
          Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older
          brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger
          boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of
          Newell’s Old Boys, a Rosario-based club. <br />ecognizably smaller
          than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed
          by doctors as suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his
          growth. Messi’s parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a regimen of
          nightly growth-hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved
          impossible to pay several hundred dollars per month for the
          medication.

        <h2>Club Teams: Barcelona, PSG, and Inter Miami</h2>
        <p>
          Messi played for FC Barcelona for 17 seasons before joining Paris
          Saint-Germain in 2021 for two seasons. In July 2023, he joined the MLS
          club Inter Miami.
        </p>

        <h2>FC Barcelona</h2>

        <p>
          FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi celebrates after scoring in a
          January 2006 match. He played for the club for 17 seasons.
          <br />At age 13, Messi signed with FC Barcelona. His first appearance
          for the team was when he was 16. On May 1, 2005, Messi put himself in
          the record books as the youngest player to ever score a goal for the
          franchise. <br />Messi steered Barcelona to a wealth of success, most
          notably in 2009, when the left-footer’s team captured the Champions
          League, La Liga, and Spanish Super Cup titles. That same year, after
          two consecutive runner-up finishes, he took home his first FIFA World
          Player of the Year honor, as well as his first Ballon d’Or award, the
          top European individual honor in football. <br />Messi became the
          first Argentinian player to win the Ballon d’Or. Even the great
          Maradona gushed about his fellow countryman. “I see him as very
          similar to me,” the retired player told the BBC. “He’s a leader and is
          offering lessons in beautiful football. He has something different
          than any other player in the world.” <br />Amazingly, the soccer
          wizard continued to improve, discovering new ways to elude defenders
          while leading Barcelona to La Liga and Spanish Super Cup championships
          in 2010 and 2011, as well as the ’11 Champions League title.
          <br />Messi embarked on an all-out assault on the record books in
          2012. He became the first player to score five goals in a Champions
          League match in early March, and a few weeks later, he surpassed Cesar
          Rodriguez’s club-record 232 goals to become Barcelona’s all-time
          leading scorer. By the end of the year, Messi had accumulated an
          astounding 91 goals in club and international play, eclipsing the 85
          netted in a single calendar year by Gerd Muller in 1972. Fittingly, he
          broke another record when he was named the Ballon d’Or winner for the
          fourth consecutive time. <br />In 2013, the soccer great came back to
          earth somewhat due to the persistence of hamstring injuries, but he
          regained his record-breaking form by becoming the all-time leading
          scorer in La Liga and Champions League play in late 2014. <br />After
          helping Barcelona achieve a historic second treble in 2015, he was
          honored with his fifth Ballon d’Or trophy. Four years later, following
          another La Liga title, Messi again established a new standard for
          excellence by claiming his sixth Ballon d’Or. <br />On August 5, 2021,
          FC Barcelona announced it couldn’t resign Messi due to the team’s
          budget constraints and La Liga restrictions. Despite having voiced his
          desire to leave the club the prior season, Messi bid a teary farewell
          after 17 seasons: “This is really difficult for me after so many years
          spent here, being here my entire life. I’m not ready for this.”
        </p>

        <h2>Paris Saint-Germain</h2>
        <div class="club-team">

        </div>
        <p>
          Four days after the shocking news from FC Barcelona, Messi signed with
          Paris Saint-Germain. The 34-year-old inked a two-year contract with
          the French club. The move saw him reunite with former teammate Neymar
          as well as the talented Kylian Mbappé.
          <br />Messi made his debut for the club on August 29, 2021, and scored
          his first goal that September. PSG won two Ligue 1 titles with Messi.
          Although his contract allowed for an optional third year at PSG, the
          team announced it would release Messi as a free agent when the deal
          expired on June 30, 2023. Earlier in the year, the club suspended and
          fined Messi after he visited Saudi Arabia on an unauthorized trip.
          This all but sealed fate on the soccer legend’s widely expected move.
          <br />Messi’s last game for PSG was June 3, 2023. In total, he started
          in 72 games, notching 32 goals and 34 assists.

        <h2>Inter Miami CF</h2>
        <div class="club-team">

          >
        </div>
        <p>
          On June 7, 2023, Messi told two Spanish media outlets he planned to
          play for the MLS club Inter Miami CF, which is partially owned by
          former soccer player David Beckham. “I have made the decision that I
          am going to Miami,” Messi said at the time, per ESPN. Messi later told
          Time he strongly considered joining a Saudi Arabian team before
          deciding on Inter Miami.
          <br />A little over a month later, on July 16, the team officially
          welcomed him on a 2.5-year contract that runs through the 2025 season.
          The deal was reportedly worth around $150 million, including an annual
          salary between $50 million and $60 million, a signing bonus, revenue
          sharing with the league’s media partner, and team equity upon
          retirement.

        <h2>Argentina National Team</h2>
        <div class="club-team">

            alt="Argentina"
          />
          <span
            >Lionel Messi in June 2005, at the start of his career with
            Argentina’s national team.</span
          >
        </div>
        <p>
          In summer 2005, Messi quickly made a name for himself on his native
          country’s under-20 squad. He led Argentina to the title in the FIFA
          U-20 World Cup, scoring on a pair of penalty kicks to propel the team
          over Nigeria. Less than two months later, he made his pro debut with
          Argentina in an August friendly match against Hungary but played less
          than two minutes before receiving a red card and being ejected from
          the game.
          <br />For all his success with Barcelona, Messi repeatedly came under
          fire for his inability to help Argentina’s national team win a major
          title. In the 2014 World Cup, Argentina lost to Germany in the final,
          though Messi was named player of the tournament that year. In 2016,
          following Argentina’s second consecutive loss to Chile in the final of
          the Copa America tournament, Messi announced he was ending his run
          with the national team. <br />The soccer great eventually reversed his
          decision, but his participation in the 2018 World Cup did not bring
          that elusive title, as hoped. After Messi scored an early goal in a
          2-1 win over Nigeria that helped his team advance from the group
          stage, he was largely kept in check by France, his two assists not
          enough to stave off a 4-3 defeat that sent Argentina packing.
          <br />The following year, after Messi heavily criticized the referees
          in the wake of a 2-0 loss to Brazil in the Copa America semifinals,
          the Argentine captain was slapped with a three-game ban by the South
          American Football Confederation. <br />At last, in 2021 and 2022,
          Argentina and Messi found enough traction to bring home trophies that
          had long evaded them. First, the team won the Copa America—Argentina’s
          first major title in 28 years—in August 2021, besting Brazil in the
          final. Captain Messi tied for top goal scorer, alongside Colombia’s
          Luis Diaz, and was named player of the tournament. The next year,
          greater glory awaited at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

        <p>
          Argentina captured the World Cup trophy on December 18, 2022, after a
          thrilling game against France that ended in a penalty shootout. Messi
          was named the Best FIFA Men’s Player for a second time and broke the
          record for most World Cup appearances with 26 games. Six jerseys that
          Messi had worn during the victorious championship run later sold for
          more than $7.8 million at auction.
          <br />In fall 2023, Messi scored three goals in qualifying games for
          the 2026 World Cup. However, as he nears the twilight of his career,
          the soccer legend has adopted a realistic attitude about his future.
          “As long as I feel that I am fine and I can continue contributing, I
          am going to do it. Today, the only thing I think about is getting to
          the Copa America well and being able to compete in it,” Messi said of
          the 2024 tournament. “Then time will tell if I am [at the World Cup]
          or not. I’m going to be at an age (39) that normally doesn’t allow me
          to play in the World Cup.”
